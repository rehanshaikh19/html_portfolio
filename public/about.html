<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Rehan Shaikh, and I am a passionate web developer with a love for creating dynamic and user-friendly websites. I have honed my skills in front-end and back-end development, as well as UI/UX design.</p>

<p>What sets me apart as a developer is my dedication to delivering high-quality work that not only meets but exceeds client expectations. I believe in the power of collaboration and communication, working closely with clients to understand their vision and turn it into a reality. Whether it's optimizing code for performance, crafting pixel-perfect designs, or ensuring cross-browser compatibility, I strive for excellence in every aspect of my work. </p>

    <li>CSS3</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>Bootstrap</li>

  </ul>

<p>Apart from coding, I am an avid learner who stays updated with the latest trends and technologies in the web development industry. I believe in continuous growth and seek out new challenges to expand my knowledge and skills.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring nature, reading books on technology and design, or volunteering for community projects. I believe in giving back to the community that has given me so much and strive to make a positive impact wherever I can.</p>
